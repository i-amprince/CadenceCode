## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get CadenceCode up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (Node Package Manager)
*   A **MongoDB Atlas** account and a connection string.
*   A **Google Cloud Project** with an OAuth 2.0 Client ID configured.
*   A **RapidAPI** account to obtain a Judge0 API Key.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-amprince/CadenceCode.git
cd CadenceCode
```

### Backend Setup

#### 2. Navigate to the `Server` directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd Server
npm install
```

#### 3. Create a `.env` file in the `Server` folder:
Create a file named `.env` and populate it with your environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for the structure.
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# API Keys
JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_judge0_api_key
JUDGE0_API_HOST=judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com

# Authentication
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_random_jwt_secret

# CORS Configuration
# Use "*" for development if you face issues, but be more specific in production.
CORS_ORIGIN=*
```
*   Replace `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string` with your actual connection string from MongoDB Atlas.
*   Replace `your_judge0_api_key` with your key from RapidAPI.
*   Replace `your_google_client_id` with your Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
*   Replace `your_super_strong_random_jwt_secret` with a long, random, and secret key.

#### 4. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```
The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

#### 5. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

#### 6. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder:
```env
# The backend URL for the React app to connect to.
# For local development, this points to your local server.
# For production, this points to your deployed backend.
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Google Client ID for the frontend authentication flow.
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
```
*   Ensure `your_google_client_id` is the **same** one used in the backend.

#### 7. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will open in your browser, typically at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.
