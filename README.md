## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get CadenceCode up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* MongoDB (local instance or cloud-hosted)
* A Google Cloud Project with OAuth 2.0 Client ID configured.
* A RapidAPI account to obtain a Judge0 API Key.

### Installation

#### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-amprince/CadenceCode.git
```

#### Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CadenceCode
```

### Backend Setup

#### Navigate to the `Server` directory:

```bash
cd Server
```

#### Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Create a `.env` file:

Create a file named `.env` in the `Server` folder and populate it with your environment variables. You can refer to `.env.example` for the structure.

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/collab-editor
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_judge0_api_key
JUDGE0_API_HOST=judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_jwt_secret
```
* Replace `your_judge0_api_key` with your actual Judge0 API Key from RapidAPI.
* Replace `your_google_client_id` with your Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
* Replace `your_super_strong_jwt_secret` with a strong, random secret key for JWT.

#### Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```
The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

#### Navigate back to the project root directory:

```bash
cd ../
```

#### Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Create a `.env` file:

Create a file named `.env` in the root (frontend) folder and add your Google Client ID:

```env
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
```
* Replace `your_google_client_id` with the same Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID used in the backend.

#### Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```
The application will open in your browser, typically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
