## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get CadenceCode up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* MongoDB (local instance or cloud-hosted)
* A Google Cloud Project with OAuth 2.0 Client ID configured.
* A RapidAPI account to obtain a Judge0 API Key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/i-amprince/CadenceCode.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd CadenceCode
    ```

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the `Server` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Server
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `Server` folder and populate it with your environment variables. You can refer to `.env.example` for the structure.

    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/collab-editor
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

    JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_judge0_api_key
    JUDGE0_API_HOST=judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com

    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_jwt_secret
    ```
    * Replace `your_judge0_api_key` with your actual Judge0 API Key from RapidAPI.
    * Replace `your_google_client_id` with your Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
    * Replace `your_super_strong_jwt_secret` with a strong, random secret key for JWT.

4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate back to the project root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root (frontend) folder and add your Google Client ID:

    ```
    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    ```
    * Replace `your_google_client_id` with the same Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID used in the backend.

4.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will open in your browser, typically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
